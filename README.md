# Build and Test
We have 3 different ways to build and test the project depending on the selected Spring Boot profile.
- `test` profile: This profile is used for unit testing. It uses an in-memory database and does not require any external dependencies.
- `local` profile: This profile is used for local development. It uses an in-memory database and generates default data to test the application. You need to run a set of docker containers to run the application (Orion Context Broker and MongoDb).

- `dev` profile: This profile is used for development. It uses a dockerized database and generates default data to test the application.
